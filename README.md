# Java-Audio-Player

This player is created in java using  Java GUI swing  and nly run .wav extension files which can we modified. To run this player simply download two java file and run in any java editor(I work with JCreator).

This is very simple player with not graphically good looking design, one can add more functionality and design to it 

Also download sample WAV file  to test player. Make sure your audio file is in same folder where you dwnloaded your java files.
